/**
 * Note: The application using this addon should import the components/list-card
 * stylesheet into app.scss _after_ the bootstrap styles
 * This can be done as follows:
 *
 * @import "node_modules/ember-list-card/addon/styles/components/list-card";
 *
 * If it is included from this file it works but it is added before bootstrap
 * which means most styles don't extend bootstrap. Maybe there's a way to
 * order when this addon's stylesheet gets included in the styles order?
